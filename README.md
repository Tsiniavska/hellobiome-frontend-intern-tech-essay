## 1. How to run the project locally:

To run the project locally:

git clone <repository URL>
cd <project folder>
npm install
npm run dev

This will start the Next.js server at http://localhost:3000.

## 2. How much time you spent:

I spent about 12.5 hours on this task, from the moment I started the project.
The project includes Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind, 4 pages (Home, Research, About Us, Contact), a header with navigation and active page highlighting, footer, reusable buttons, logo component, basic styles, locally loaded fonts, and a page displaying a list of microorganisms with filtering and sorting functionality.

## 3. What you would improve with more time:

With more time, I would:

- Create a custom select component, allowing it to be separated and providing more styling options than the native select.
- Spend more time refining the design and responsiveness of the pages.
- Add some additional interactivity on the template pages to make the site feel like a more complete application.
